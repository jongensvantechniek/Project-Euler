# Project-Euler
Solutions to Project Euler Problems

## Rules
* Each program should be able to produce the answer on the command-line.
* Each solution should be confined in it's own solution folder.
* Solution folders should pass the following regular expression:

`problem[0-9]+-(bash|c|cpp|cs|fsharp|java|go|haskell|js|php|python|ruby|swift)$`.
* If your language is not supported by this previously stated regular expression, update the documentation.
* The source code of your solution should contain the problem definition as a comment.
* The source code is not allowed to contain the final answer to solutions.
* The source code should contain explanatory comments.
* The comments must be properly formulated in English.
* Reusing source code should be confined in it's own common folder.
* Common folders should pass the following regular expression:

`common+-(bash|c|cpp|cs|fsharp|java|go|haskell|js|php|python|ruby|swift)$`
* If your language is not supported by this previously stated regular expression, update the documentation.
* Solutions that are work in progress should be stored in the development branch or in a seperate branch from the master.
* The master branch may only contain correct solutions that abide the previously stated rules.
